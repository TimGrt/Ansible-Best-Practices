# Variables

## Where to put variables

I always store all my variables at the following **three** locations:

* *group_vars* folder
* *host_vars* folder
* *defaults* folder in roles

The *defaults*-folder contains only default values for all variables used by the role.

## Naming Variables

The variable name should be self-explanatory (*as brief as possible, as detailed as necessary*), use multiple words and don't shorten things.

* Multiple words are separated with underscores (`_`)
* *List*-Variables are suffixed with `_list`
* *Dictionary*-Variables are suffixed with `_dict`
* *Boolean* values are provided with lowercase `true` or `false`

        create_key: yes
        needsAgent: no
        knows_oop: True
        ```

## Referencing variables

After a variable is defined, use *Jinja2* syntax to reference it. Jinja2 variables use *double curly braces* (`{{` and `}}`).  
Use spaces after and before the double curly braces and the variable name.  
When referencing *list* or *dictionary* variables, try to use the *bracket notation* instead of the *dot notation*.
Bracket notation always works and you can use variables inside the brackets. Dot notation can cause problems because some keys collide with attributes and methods of python dictionaries.

=== "Good"
    !!! good-practice-no-title ""
        Simple variable reference:
        ```yaml
        - name: Deploy configuration file
          ansible.builtin.template:
            src: foo.cfg.j2
            dest: "{{ remote_install_path }}/foo.cfg"
        ```
        Bracket-notation and using variable (*interface_name*) inside:
        ```yaml
        - name: Output IPv4 address of {{ interface_name }} interface
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "{{ ansible_facts[interface_name]['ipv4']['address'] }}"
        ```
=== "Bad"
    !!! bad-practice-no-title ""
        Not using whitespaces around variable name.
        ``` { .yaml .no-copy }
        - name: Deploy configuration file
          ansible.builtin.template:
            src: foo.cfg.j2
            dest: "{{remote_install_path}}/foo.cfg"
        ```
        Not using whitespaces and using dot-notation.
        ``` { .yaml .no-copy }
        - name: Output IPv4 address of eth0 interface
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "{{ansible_facts.eth0.ipv4.address}}"
        ```

## Encrypted variables

!!! tip
    All variables with sensitive content should be *vault*-encrypted.  

Although encrypting just the value of a single variable is possible (with `ansible-vault encrypt_string`), you should avoid this. Store all sensitive variables in a single file and encrypt the whole file.  
For example, to store sensitive variables in `group_vars`, create the subdirectory for the group and within create two files named `vars.yml` and `vault.yml`.  
Inside of the `vars.yml` file, define all of the variables needed, including any sensitive ones. Next, copy all of the sensitive variables over to the `vault.yml` file and prefix these variables with `vault_`. Adjust the variables in the *vars* file to point to the matching *vault_* variables using Jinja2 syntax, and ensure that the vault file is vault encrypted.

        ```yaml
        ---
        # file: group_vars/database_servers/vars.yml
        username: "{{ vault_username }}"
        password: "{{ vault_password }}"
        ```
        ```yaml
        ---
        # file: group_vars/database_servers/vault.yml
        # NOTE: THIS FILE MUST ALWAYS BE VAULT-ENCRYPTED
        vault_username: admin
        vault_password: ex4mple
        ```
        ??? info "I can still read the credentials...?"
            Obviously, you wouldn't be able to read the content of the file `group_vars/database_servers/vault.yml`, as the file would be encrypted.  
            **This only demonstrates how the variables are referencing each other.**  
            The encrypted `vault.yml` file looks something like this:
            ``` { .yaml .no-copy }

        # file: group_vars/database_servers.yml
        username: admin
        password: ex4mple
        ```

Defining variables this way makes sure that you can still find them with *grep*.  
Encrypting files can be done with this command:

```console
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/database_servers/vault.yml
```

Once a variable file is encrypted, it should **not** be decrypted again (because it may get committed unencrypted). View or edit the file like this:

```console
ansible-vault view group_vars/database_servers/vault.yml
```

```console
ansible-vault edit group_vars/database_servers/vault.yml
```

!!! warning
    There are modules which will print the values of encrypted variables into STDOUT while using them or with higher verbosity. Be sure to check the parameters and return values of all modules which use encrypted variables!

A good example is the `ansible.builtin.user` module, it automatically obfuscates the value for the *password* parameter, replacing it with the string `NOT_LOGGING_PASSWORD`.  
The `ansible.builtin.debug` module on the other hand is a bad example, it will output the password in clear-text (well, by design, but this is not what you would expect)!

!!! success
    Always add the **`no_log: true`** key-value-pair for tasks that run the risk of leaking vault-encrypted content!

            ```
            The *debug* task does not print the value of the password, the output is censored.

            !!! hint
                Observing the output from the *"Add user"* task, you can see that the value of the *password* parameter is not shown.
                The *warning* from the *"Add user"* task stating an unencrypted password is related to not having hashed the password. You can achieve this by using the *password_hash* filter:
                ```yaml
                password: "{{ vault_password | password_hash('sha512', 'mysecretsalt') }}"
                ```
                This example uses the string `mysecretsalt` for salting, in cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function. Consider using a variable for the salt and treat it the same as the password itself!
                ```yaml
                password: "{{ vault_password | password_hash('sha512', vault_salt) }}"
                ```
                In this example, the salt is stored in a variable, the same way as the password itself. If you hashed the password, the warning will disappear.

### Prevent unintentional commits

Use a *pre-commit hook* to prevent accidentally committing unencrypted sensitive content. The easiest way would be to use the *pre-commit* framework/tool with the following configuration:

```yaml title=".pre-commit-config.yaml"
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/timgrt/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v0.2.1
      hooks:
        - id: check-vault-files
```

Take a look at the [development section](linting.md#git-pre-commit-hook) for additional information.

## Disable variable templating

Sometimes, it is necessary to provide special characters like curly braces. The most common use cases include passwords that allow special characters like `{` or `%`, and JSON arguments that look like templates but should not be templated.  

```{ .yaml .no-copy }
---
examplepassword: !unsafe 234%234{435lkj{{lkjsdf
```

!!! abstract
    When handling values returned by lookup plugins, Ansible uses a data type called `unsafe` to block templating. Marking data as unsafe prevents malicious users from abusing Jinja2 templates to execute arbitrary code on target machines. The Ansible implementation `!unsafe` ensures that these values are never templated. You can use the same unsafe data type in variables you define, to prevent templating errors and information disclosure.

For complex variables such as hashes or arrays, use `!unsafe` on the individual elements, take a look at [this example for AWX/AAP automation](credentials.md#automation-and-templating).

For Jinja2 templates this behavior can be achieved with the `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` tags.  
Consider the following *template* where *name_of_receiver_group* should be replaced with a variable you set elsewhere, but *details* contains stuff which should stay as it is:

```{ .yaml .title="templates/alertmanager.yml.j2" .no-copy }
receivers:
- name: "{{ name_of_receiver_group }}"
  opsgenie_configs:
  - api_key: 123-123-123-123-123
    send_resolved: false
    {% raw %}
    # protecting the go templates inside the raw section.
    details: { details: "{{ .CommonAnnotations.SortedPairs.Values | join \" \" }}" }
    {% endraw %}
```
